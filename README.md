# PREPARED-toolbox

PREPARED toolbox: calibration and data assimilation

The toolbox results from work undertaken on the PREPARED: enabling change European Commision FP7 project.

The toolbox contains methods for:

Model calibration: based on Bayesian probabilistic approaches, and implements both formal and informal Bayesian methods

Data Assimilation and Error Correction: Ensemble Particle Filter for real-time model correction, and an Artificial Neural Network class
for model error correction
